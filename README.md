# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning JavaScript from the ground up. I've been systematically working through fundamental concepts and practicing with code examples.

## Repository Structure

- **01_FUNDAMENTAL_PART_01**: Basic JavaScript concepts and syntax.....
- **02_FUNDAMENTAL_PART_02**: More advanced JavaScript concepts including functions and arrays
- **03_DEVELOPER_SKILLS**: Developer tools and debugging techniques
- **04_HTML-CSS**: HTML and CSS fundamentals
- **05_Guess_My_Number**: Interactive number guessing game project
- **06_MODAL**: Modal dialog implementation
- **07_PIG_GAME**: Dice game project
- **08_Behind_the_Scene**: JavaScript engine internals and how JavaScript works under the hood

## What I've Learned So Far

### Fundamentals Part 1

- **Variables and Values**: Using `let`, `const`, and variable naming conventions
- **Data Types**: Understanding primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null)
- **Basic Operators**: Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators
- **Operator Precedence**: Understanding how JavaScript evaluates expressions
- **Strings**: String manipulation, template literals, and multi-line strings
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`/`else` statements and conditional (ternary) operator
- **Type Conversion and Coercion**: Explicitly and implicitly converting between types
- **Truthy and Falsy Values**: Understanding which values evaluate to true/false
- **Equality Operators**: Difference between strict (`===`) and loose (`==`) equality
- **Boolean Logic**: Using AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) operators

### Fundamentals Part 2

- **Strict Mode**: Using 'use strict' for safer JavaScript
- **Functions**:
  - Function declarations vs. expressions
  - Arrow functions and their syntax
  - Functions calling other functions
  - Function parameters and return values
- **Arrays**:
  - Creating and accessing arrays
  - Array methods (`push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`)
  - Arrays with different data types
  - Array destructuring
- **Objects**:
  - Object creation and structure
  - Dot notation vs. bracket notation
  - Adding and modifying object properties
  - Object methods and the `this` keyword
  - Dynamic property access
- **Loops and Iteration**:
  - For loops (standard, nested loops)
  - While loops
  - Looping through arrays
  - `continue` and `break` statements
  - Looping backwards
- **Advanced Concepts**:
  - Destructuring assignment
  - Mathematical operations (`Math.random()`, `Math.trunc()`)
  - Template literals for complex string building
  - Practical coding challenges and problem-solving

## Next Steps in My Learning Journey

As I continue my JavaScript learning, I plan to explore:

- More array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)
- Advanced object concepts and prototypes
- DOM manipulation and events
- Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Error handling and debugging
- Modern JavaScript features (ES6+ modules, classes)

## How to Open Modules in the Browser Console

To explore any of the modules and see console output:

1. Navigate to the module folder (e.g., `08_Behind_the_Scene`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or **"Inspect Element"**
4. Click on the **"Console"** tab to view JavaScript console output
5. The scripts will execute and display output, errors, and logs in the console

**For 08_Behind_the_Scene**: This module demonstrates how JavaScript works behind the scenes. Open `08_Behind_the_Scene/index.html` in your browser, open the console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I), and explore the execution context, variable scope, and how the JavaScript engine processes code.
