# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning JavaScript from the ground up. I've been systematically working through fundamental concepts and practicing with code examples.

## Repository Structure

- **01_FUNDAMENTAL_PART_01**: Basic JavaScript concepts and syntax
- **02_FUNDAMENTAL_PART_02**: More advanced JavaScript concepts including functions and arrays

## What I've Learned So Far

### Fundamentals Part 1

- **Variables and Values**: Using `let`, `const`, and variable naming conventions
- **Data Types**: Understanding primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null)
- **Basic Operators**: Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators
- **Operator Precedence**: Understanding how JavaScript evaluates expressions
- **Strings**: String manipulation, template literals, and multi-line strings
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`/`else` statements and conditional (ternary) operator
- **Type Conversion and Coercion**: Explicitly and implicitly converting between types
- **Truthy and Falsy Values**: Understanding which values evaluate to true/false
- **Equality Operators**: Difference between strict (`===`) and loose (`==`) equality
- **Boolean Logic**: Using AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) operators

### Fundamentals Part 2

- **Strict Mode**: Using 'use strict' for safer JavaScript
- **Functions**:
  - Function declarations vs. expressions
  - Arrow functions and their syntax
  - Functions calling other functions
  - Function parameters and return values
- **Arrays**:
  - Creating and accessing arrays
  - Basic array methods (`push`, `pop`)
  - Arrays with different data types

## Next Steps in My Learning Journey

As I continue my JavaScript learning, I plan to explore:

- More array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Objects and object-oriented programming
- DOM manipulation
- Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Error handling
- Modern JavaScript features (ES6+)

## Resources Used

- Online tutorials
- Coding exercises
- Practice projects
